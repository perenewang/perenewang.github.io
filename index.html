        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            hi, my name is perene wang. a thing about me is that i like to code, mainly for the feeling of satisfaction when i
            finish a project after spending countless hours typing away. i love making websites and games, really anything that
            people can see and play around with â€” something that feels physical, but in a digital way.
            school: university of chicago '23
            major: computer science
            minor: media arts and design
            <br>
